# 2048 in Java

A little, but robust and rigorous, project I created when I was getting started with Java. `Board.java` defines the `Board` interface, `GameBoard.java` implements this interface, and `Main.java` contains the code for the main function that runs the game loop.

The game is run by executing:
```zsh
    javac Main.java
    java Main
```
